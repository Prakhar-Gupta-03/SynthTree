# L-system-tree-modelling
Implementation of the paper [L-systems: From the theory to visual models of plants](http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/l-sys.csiro96.pdf) as the course project for the course CSE333: Computer Graphics at IIIT Delhi. The project was done by [Shreyas Kabra](https://github.com/shreyas21563/) and [Prakhar Gupta](https://github.com/Prakhar-Gupta-03/).

## Pre-requisites: 
* OpenGL (version 3.3 or above)
* CMake
* C++ 17

## How to build and run 
1. `git clone https://github.com/Prakhar-Gupta-03/L-system-tree-modelling.git`
2. Move to the root of the directory 
3. `bash build.sh`
4. Run `./L-System-Based-3D-Tree-Modelling`

## Final Results

# L-system-tree-modelling
Implementation of the paper "L-systems: from the theory to visual models of plants" as a course project for CSE333: Computer Graphics
